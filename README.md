# VentilAid

VentilAid - open source ventilator, that can be made anywhere locally
Files names are in Polish - we will fix it and change to English untill 24-25th of March 2020. 

The parts required to assemble the VentilAid are divided into two groups:
1) Printable parts
2) Parts that are mass-produced worldwide

As for the first group, the instructions are the following:
- Print the bellow out of elastic material, for instance TPU. For best results please use material of hardness 80 in Shore A scale. When slicing, the best settings appear to be 1 loop with 0.6-0.7 extrusion width. Apply "Vase mode" whenever it is possible.

- Other 3D printed parts should be sliced with following settings: 2 loops, approx. 15% infill density, layer height from 0.2 mm to 0.5 mm.

The second group contains parts, which are ought to be purchased from local supplier. The list is available below:
- Double acting pneumatic actuator with 16 mm piston and 100-200 mm stroke (the stroke length is responsible for "breath" capacity)
- 12 V solenoid oneumatic valve with adjustable air outlet (mono- or bistable)
- 12 V DC power supply - almost any kind will work
- Standarized pneumatic pressure regulator with approx. 2 bar on the output.
- Source of pneumatic pressure - Ventilaid should work even on compressors for hobbyists

The check-valve and the pressure controller require a soft, elastic discs with hardness of approx. 40 Shore A (or less) and maximal thickness of 1mm - if the supply is low one can make on out of old bike tire tube.
